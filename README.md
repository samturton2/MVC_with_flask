**Why Flask**
- Flask is a web app framework
- Very powerful to interact with DB and user interface/ browsers etc
- Flask can be used to create an API
- It allows us to integrate with HTML, CSS, JS

functions - URL - HTTP GET
- It allows us to set the API path as URL to view in the browser

```
pip install flask
```
- Ensure flask is installed

```
flask run
```
